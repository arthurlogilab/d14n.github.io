# Concerning languages
The world is a pretty diverse place.  So is the Internet.  People speak a lot of different languages, be it English, French, Tamil, Python, or Rust.  The d14n project is fundamentally language-agnostic, and although this page happens to be written in English, that doesn't mean English is the preferred language.  In other words, the d14n project is not about language politics - the important thing is that we are able to communicate at all. :smile:

The first meet-up was held in Paris.  Paris, being the campital of France, is primarily a Francophone city. :fr: It therefore stands to reason that most of the attendees spoke French either as a first language, or were generally conversant as a second (or third, or more).  As a result, a lot of the [content generated during that meet-up]({% post_url 2014-07-31-first-post %}) was in French, and that's OK.  As the movement spreads I hope (and expect) to see content in more and more languages because, as I mentioned previously, the Internet is a pretty diverse place.

So let's get to talking! :information_desk_person:
