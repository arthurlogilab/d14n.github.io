# The d14n project is live!

We had our [first meet-up](http://www.meetup.com/Paris-Meetup-pour-la-decentralisation-dInternet/events/193618842/) at the fabulous [Mozilla Paris](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/paris/) space. There were some 50 people in attendance throughout the day, participating in working groups on diverse topics, as well as hacking on a variety of interesting open source projects.

### More to come!
